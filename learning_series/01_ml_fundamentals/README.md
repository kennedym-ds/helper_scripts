## Key Concepts Summary

### Machine Learning Types
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled examples
  - Classification: Predicting categories (spam/not spam)
  - Regression: Predicting continuous values (house prices)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - Clustering: Grouping similar items
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data while preserving information
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- **High Bias (Underfitting)**: Model is too simple, misses patterns
- **High Variance (Overfitting)**: Model is too complex, memorizes noise
- **Sweet Spot**: Balanced model that generalizes well

### Model Evaluation
- Always use separate test data
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Choose metrics appropriate for your problem
- Consider business impact, not just statistical metrics

## Exercises

1. **Concept Quiz**: Test your understanding of key terms
2. **Identify ML Types**: Categorize real-world problems
3. **Overfitting Detection**: Analyze learning curves
4. **Metrics Selection**: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics
5. **Complete Project**: Build your first ML classifier

## Estimated Time

**Total Duration:** 3-4 days (8-12 hours)
