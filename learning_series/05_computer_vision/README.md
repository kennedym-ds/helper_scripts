### Feature Extraction Techniques
- **Edges**: Boundaries between different regions
- **Corners**: Points where edges meet
- **Textures**: Patterns in image regions
- **Shapes**: Geometric properties of objects

### Traditional CV Pipeline

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.imshow(image_rgb)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.title('Original Image')
    plt.show()
    
    return image_rgb

# Edge detection example

    \"\"\"Extract color histogram features\"\"\"
    features = []
    for channel in range(3):  # RGB channels
        hist = cv2.calcHist([image], [channel], None, [32], [0, 256])
